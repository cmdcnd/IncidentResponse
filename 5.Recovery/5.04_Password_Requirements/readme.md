## Task Password_Requirements: Define and implement best password policies and practices  


## Conditions  
Given a network, implement stronger password policies  


## Standards  
Upon moving into the Recovery Phase, the IR Team should recommend stronger password policies  

* Remove Periodic Password Change Requirements
* Use A Password Manager
  * Recommend the use of a secure Password Manager (i.e. KeePass, LastPass, etc.)
* Minimum Password Length
  * Ensure password length of at least 8 characters in accordance with NIST standards.
  * Encourage the use of passphrases (a string if words that makes a password long and memorable)
* Implement Screening of New Passwords
  * When processing requests to establish and change memorized secrets, verifiers SHALL compare the prospective secrets against a list that contains values known to be commonly-used, expected, or compromised. For example, the list MAY include, but is not limited to:  

Passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses. 
* Dictionary words  
* Repetitive or sequential characters (e.g. `aaaaaa`, `1234abcd`)  
* Context-specific words, such as the name of the service, the username, and derivatives thereof  

## End State  
The IR Team provides secure password policies to implement
