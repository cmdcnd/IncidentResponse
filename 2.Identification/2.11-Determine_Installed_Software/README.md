	```  

	```bat
	wmic /output:"C:\%Computername%_software.txt" product get name,version /format:"C:\Windows\System32\wbem\en-us\csv"  
	```  

* WMIC: as Administrator (Run with cmd. Use for remote computers)  
	```bat
	wmic /node:"computername" product get name,version /format:csv > c:\ software.txt  
	```  
  
* PSInfo (Sysinternals) run command from the directory where PSInfo is installed/located  
	```bat
	psinfo \\computername -u username -p password -s > c:\software.txt  
	```  

Output should be in the format identified in `output_format_template.csv` and named [mm/dd/yyyy_hh:mm:ss_Installed_Software_(computer name)]
