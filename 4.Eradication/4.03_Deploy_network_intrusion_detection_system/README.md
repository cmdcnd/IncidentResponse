## Task Deploy Network Intrusion Detction System  


## Conditions  
Deploy:  IR Team supporting a mission partner or Guardnet/DoDIN enclave without appropriate Network IDS or IPS installations.  
Evaluate: IR Team supporting a mission partner or Guardnet/DoDIN enclave with access to appropriate systems / capabilities to evaluate existing Network IDS or IPS installations.  


## Standards  
Deploy: Same as Evaluate (below) with the exception of assessing mission partner or Guardnet/DoDin enclave networks for placement of IDPS capabilities. Additionally, as requested or directed deploy IDPS capabilities. Once deployed, conduct the Evaluate process to assess operational effectiveness.  
* Identify and prepare Detection Systems.  
	* Find what systems are available or what is necessary to Mission (likely to be directed if Unit is not allowed).  
	* Identify/Rate strengths and weaknesses of systems.  
	* Install necessary programs/systems critical to Mission.  
* Identify or Obtain login credentials  
	* Obtain IP path to login.  
	* Obtain/create User ID to login.  
	* Obtain/create Password (ensure strong password creation).  
* Test accessibility.  
	* Connect to the system with credentials.  
	* Report inconsistencies  
* Develop the detection scheme.  
	* Establish detection plan following the evaluation of the network (see below).  
	* Re-evaluate and continue to develop improved detection throughout the mission.  

Evaluate (and assess):  
* Identify and correlate current system to typical components and network architectures. Build or utilize a Common Operating Picture for the team. (see Figures 4-2 and 4-3, below)  
* Identify/locate potential entry points to network.  
	* Identify Internet entry points.  
	* Identify “contained” wireless connections within the network.  
* Identify/locate choke points and fire walls.  
	* Identify locations on the network where information traffic must travel.  
	* Identify fire wall control points and what is "protected by" the wall.  
	* Grade firewalls on placement. (use Figures 4-2 and 4-3 to determine standards)  
	* Grade protection of zones with independent fail conditions as safer. (i.e. if Zone A’s Firewall is lost is Zone B compromised as well? Does compromise fail a switch/router critical to multiple Zones?)  
* Identify/locate current detection systems, and sensors.  
	* Identify where detection systems are located on the network.  
	* Identify where on the system sensors are installed.  
	* Identify path(s) from the IR Team entry point to the detection system(s).  
	* Identify paths from the detection system(s) to the network sensors.  
	* Grade said sensors based on choke point vulnerabilities and Zones covered.  
* Identify full system maintenance schedule.  
	* Patch schedule for network component firmware (routers, switches, etc.).  
	* Patch schedule for each firewall.  
	* Patch/update schedule for detection system.  
	* Grade how often each related patch update is available and equivalent components are capable thereof.  

Components and Architecture  
* Typical Components  
* Network Architectures  

Security Capabilities  
* Information Gathering Capabilities  
* Logging Capabilities  
* Detection Capabilities  
* Prevention Capabilities  

Management  
* Implementation
