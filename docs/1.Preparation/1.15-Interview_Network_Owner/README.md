It is important to discuss the existing sensors, network monitoring and cyber defense tools (e.g., firewalls, Security Event Information Manager (SIEM), forensics, malware detection, network discovery and mapping) with the mission owner to determine what is already in place as part of the mission preparation phase. Based on that interview and the tools available, open source best practices and capabilities), the CPT should discuss additional sensors or tools with the organizations Network owner to determine the tools that are needed for the mission.
