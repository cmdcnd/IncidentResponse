## Task Conduct Vulnerability Scan of Network Host  


## Conditions  
Given a host with local administrator credentials, an incident response workstation, network access, and a vulnerability assessment tool   


## Standards  
* Team member verifies network connectivity to the host using the host IP address  
* Team member assures the vulnerability assessment tool is using the latest updates and signatures of the selected tool  
* Team member configures the vulnerability assessment tool with the IP address of the host  
* Team member selects assessment options within the tool based on testing level required   
  * Note: Some tests can cause denial of service to host and will need to be evaluated before beginning of assessment  
* Team member runs the assessment with selected options and monitors progress  
* Team member evaluates the results of the assessment and determines if critical or high vulnerabilities exist on the test machine  


## End State  
All vulnerabilities on the test machine are found and critical or high results are evaluated for remediation  


## Manual Steps  
* Determine if the client/victim currently have designated in-house vulnerability tools  
* Identify if the customer has a service account to conduct your scans. [See Task 1.18 Establish Network Access Accounts](/1.Preparation/1.18-Request_Network_Accounts)  
* Request a network topolgy from the network owner(if available)  
  * Verify network topology with a ping sweep   
* Establish and separate vulnerability scan groups by Operating Systems(Win/Linux)  
  * Narrow vulnerability scans prevent false results  
* Verify the credentials you are using to scan have:  
  * `Sudo` privilege for Unix/Linux  
  * `Administrator group` for Windows
