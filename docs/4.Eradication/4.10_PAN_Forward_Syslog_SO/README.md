## Task: Configure Palo Alto Networking Device to forward all Alerts and Logs to SysLog Server  


## Conditions  
Given a Palo Alto Networking device and Syslog server.  


## Standards  
* Team member validates Palo Alto device is 'seeing' traffic as intended on target network segments.  
* Team member configures log forwarding to Security Onion device appropriately.  


## End State  
Logs are forwarded and parsed by Security Onion NIDS and searchable in Kibana.  


## Notes  

	
## Manual Steps  
* Log into Palo Alto Networking WebUI  
	* Username: Admin 
	* Password: <get from network owner>  
* Ensure PAN Service route for Syslog messages is set to same subnet as Syslog/SO/SIEM servers  
	* Open Service routes under Device > Setup > Services tab  
	* Select [Service Route Configuration]  
	* Change Service Route Configuration to [Customize]  
		* Either select All Services, or you can define which Interface the respective services use.  
	* Change the service route IP address to Custom  
	* Click `Syslog` under Services  
		* Change `Source Interface` to ethernet interface connected to Syslog servers  
		* Change `Source Address` to IP Address on same subnet of Syslog server

* Create Syslog Server Profile.  This profile should identify the IP of the Syslog server on the network and Port the Syslog server will be listening on for incoming logs.  
	* Device > Server Profiles > Syslog  
	* Select the `Add` button at the bottom  
	* Create any name for the Syslog Profile  
	* Click `Add` button under the newly created profile, and fill in:  
		* Name: Can be anything  
		* Syslog Server: Can be IP or FQDN  
		* Transport: UDP (Default) or TCP â€“ Based on capabilities of network.   
			* Ensure Syslog Server has Firewall configured to accept Syslogs over UDP or TCP  
			* UDP may result in loss of logs due to connectionless communication.   
			* TCP may cause resource exhaustion of networking devices due to increased communication requirements.  
		* Port: 514 (Default)  
			* Ensure Syslog Server has firewall configured to accept Syslogs over port 514.
