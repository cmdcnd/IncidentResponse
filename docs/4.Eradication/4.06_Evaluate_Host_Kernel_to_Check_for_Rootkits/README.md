# Task Evaluate Host Kernel to Check for Rootkits  


## Conditions  
Given a suspected compromised Windows desktop computer system, a local administrator account, incident response tools, and one or more Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).  


## Standards  
* The team member annotates the system name, serial number, manufacturer, and time of action in the Incident Log.   
* The team member inserts media that contains the rootkit detection application.   
* The team member runs the rootkit detection application with the correct parameters and exports the data to the local drive, external USB media, or network share. a. Removal of the rootkit is not part of this evaluation, only identification. Removal is part of Task 4.25: Stop Malware â€“ Rootkit.  
* Review screen or tool log file for indicators of the presence of a rootkit against provided IOCs  


## End State  
rootkit-related elements are identified  


## Notes  
When a rootkit is suspected, there are various considerations to consider when determining the best method to complete this task. Based on the IOCs some research of the suspected rootkit may preclude the connection of USB drives which may in turn be compromised. This task can be accomplished remotely using PSExec or batch file. Some tools require renaming before being copied to the compromised machine and should be covered in their documentation.
