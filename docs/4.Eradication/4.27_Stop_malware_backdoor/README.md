## Task Stop malware backdoor  


## Conditions  
Given a compromised system, perform steps to stop malware backdoors and C2 beaconing.  


## Standards  
* Run Stop_malware_backdoor.ps1 and an executable will named Cerberus.exe will appear.  
* Cerberus.exe will need to be run with administrator privileges.  
* Use Cerberus to either analyze, suspend, or kill the malware backdoor or C2 beaconing.  

## End State  
System processes will be cleared of malicious code injection and back to its normal state.  


## Notes  
* Cerberus will only go after the thread from within the process that it is hunting. There will not be a need to restart a process due to the fact that Cerberus is killing the thread that is infected, and _ONLY_ that thread. It will not kill the process.  
* This Task will also apply to 4.28_Stop_C2_Beaconing  


## Manual Steps  
* Run Stop_malware_backdoor.ps1  
* Run Cerberus with --analyze or -a to analyze all of the hosts current running processes.  
* Run Cerberus with --suspend or -s to suspend the threads. This will not kill the thread, only suspend it that way malicious activities are not running while keeping the process running.  
* Run Cerberus with --kill or -k to kill the thread. The thread will be terminated and will not continue to beacon or be used as a backdoor. The process will not need to be restarted.
