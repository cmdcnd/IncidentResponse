## Task Provide cyber security improvement recommendations to Mission Partner (MP)  


## Conditions  
Given an IR Team deployed supporting a designated MP in Cyber Incident Recovery.  


## Standards  
Upon moving into the Recovery Phase, the DCO-E should review their documentation and findings (from previous port, network, service, and vulnerability scans) to provide improvement recommendations to the MP.  These recommendations may include the following areas:  

* Unauthorized Devices  
* Unauthorized Software  
* Hardware and Software Configurations  
* Vulnerability Assessments and Remediation  
* Administrative Privileges  
* Maintenance, Monitoring, and Analysis of Logs  
* Email and Web Browser  
* Malware Defense  
* Management of Network Ports  
* Data Recovery  
* Network Device Configurations  
* Boundary Defense  
* Data Protection  
* Need to Know Access  
* Wireless Access  
* User Account Management  
* User Cyber Security Training  
* Application Software Security  
* Incident Response Management  
* Cyber Security Exercises  

The IR Team should provide recommendations in a format agreed upon with the supported MP.  


## End State  
IR Team provides written recommendations to the supported MP on improving their cyber security posture (minimum focus on the network defense plan).  


## Notes  
Providing cyber security improvement recommendations begins with solid documentation of vulnerabilities identified upon arriving on site.
