## Conduct After Action Review to support redeployment efforts Task  


## Conditions  
Given an IR Team deployed supporting a designated MP in Cyber Incident Recovery.  


## Standards  
Upon moving into the redeployment Phase, the IR Team should develop an AAR containing the following elements:  

* List of Participants  
* Review key actions/event that occurred during mission  
* Analysis of Lessons Learned  
* Remediation plans to prevent this from occurring in the future  
* Discussion of final indicators of compromise to share for detection of potential incidents across the community  
* Staff performance review  
* Corrective actions review  
* Tool utilization review  
* Process gaps review  
* Documentation gaps review  
* Training review  
This list is not exhaustive. If the IR Team produces it during mission, it should be considered an artifact and turned over to the supported MP.  


## End State  
The IR Team completes a full after action review with MP. The MP contains knowledge from knowing lessons learned, ways to prevent future incidents, and how to detect an actionable incident.
