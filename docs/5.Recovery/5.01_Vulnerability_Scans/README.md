## Task Update the initial supported Mission Partner (MP) vulnerability assessment (VA) (scan)  


## Conditions  
Given an IR Team deployed supporting a designated MP in Cyber Incident Recovery.  


## Standards  
In coordination with the supported MP, the DCO-E should:  

* Review initial the VA and document any/all changes made to improve security  
* Conduct a port scan and document deltas with original scans  
* Conduct a vulnerability scan and document deltas with the original scans  
* As needed conduct a web application vulnerability scan (e.g. Burp Suite) and document deltas  
* As needed test firewalls, IDS/IPS, proxies and boundary defense appliance configurations and document deltas  
* Provide End of Assessment Nessus Report  
* Additional assessments as needed 

## End State 
The IR Team provides an updated VA & scan to the support mission partner in order to document any actions taken during Eradication and Recovery phases.   


## Notes  
Depending on the severity and/or complexity of the cyber incident, the DCO-E may consider conducting another full vulnerability assessment. At a minimum, full network/system scans with tools such as NMAP, OpenVAS, NESSUS, orothers is critical.
